# market scene

Original dependency-free WebGL geometry and shaders. The market illustration is decorative, not data. Uses a 30 fps limit, capped pixel density, visibility/intersection pausing, a pause button, reduced-motion defaults and animated Canvas 2D fallback on unavailable/lost WebGL. Tree growth can also be scrubbed manually and is not a biological prediction. No third-party model/CDN, tracking, paid service or image licence is needed.

Existing core tools remain available without graphics. Deployment uses the existing Pages workflow where configured.


If WebGL is unavailable, Canvas 2D projects the same animated 3D geometry. A static SVG is the final fallback when neither renderer is available.
